SAN FRANCISCO   There were no test tubes or Bunsen burners, but a courtroom turned into a science classroom Wednesday for a U.S. judge considering lawsuits that accuse big oil companies of lying about the role of fossil fuels in the Earth\'s warming environment.Leading researchers taught U.S. District Judge William Alsup the basic science of climate change at the unusual court hearing after he asked lawyers for two California cities and five of the world\'s largest oil and gas companies to present "the best science now available on global warming."He cautioned at the start of the hearing against expecting "fireworks" and said he wanted to avoid politics and "stick to the science.""This is a serious proposition to try to educate the judge," Alsup said.What he got at the end of the nearly five-hour hearing was a primer on the history of climate change research, carbon dioxide\'s role as a greenhouse gas, melting ice caps, rising sea levels and extreme weather.His teachers included Myles Allen, a professor at the University of Oxford who studies human influences on climate, and Don Wuebbles, an expert in atmospheric science at the University of Illinois who co-authored a 2017 U.S. government report on climate change.An attorney for Chevron, Theodore Boutrous, also presented, saying the oil giant does not dispute the findings of an international panel of scientists that it is extremely likely people are the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-1900s.But he pointed out how thinking about global warming has evolved and said the company does not agree with all proposals in place to deal with it."The notion that we know today of a dynamic changing climate is relatively new in human understanding," he said.Alsup interrupted Boutrous and the scientists to ask about the climate on Mars, what caused the ice age and whether the ozone layer has a role in the warming and cooling of the planet, among other questions.He is considering two lawsuits, one by San Francisco and the other by neighboring Oakland, that accuse Chevron, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, BP and Royal Dutch Shell of long knowing that fossil fuels posed serious risks to the climate, but still promoting them as environmentally responsible. They also allege the companies mounted campaigns to downplay the risks of global warming and discredit research that human activity was to blame.The companies have asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuits. Federal law controls fossil fuel production, and Congress has encouraged oil and gas development, they said in court documents. They say the harm the cities claim is "speculative" and part of a complex chain of events that includes billions of oil and gas users and "environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades."Legal observers said they had never heard of a court holding a tutorial on climate change, and they were eager to see how the oil companies explained global warming.None of the other companies spoke. Alsup told their attorneys that he wanted them to file documents indicating whether they disagreed with what Chevron\'s attorney said."You can\'t get away with sitting there in silence and later say he wasn\'t speaking for us," the judge said.The lawsuits say the companies have created a public nuisance and should pay for sea walls and other infrastructure to protect against the effects of climate change  construction that could cost billions of dollars.New York City, several California counties and at least one other California city have filed similar suits.San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said the hearing showed the science on climate change was "clear.""What we saw today was one oil company begrudgingly accept the scientific consensus while trying to overemphasize the extent of scientific uncertainty," he said in a statement.

OSLO   Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world\'s biggest brewer, said on Wednesday it would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by a quarter by 2025 and help thousands of farmers cope with disruptions to water supplies stoked by global warming.The Belgium-based brewer also said it would make all its packaging either returnable or from mainly recycled materials by 2025 and was on track to achieve a goal set in 2017 to get all the electricity it buys from renewable sources by 2025."It\'s a win-win ... It\'s good for business and good for the environment", chief executive Carlos Brito told Reuters of the new sustainability goals. He declined to estimate the total cost of the measures or the impact on earnings.Brito said AB InBev, whose beers include Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois, was vulnerable to environmental changes since it relied on barley, malt, hops, wheat, rice and other products grown by 50,000 farmers in dozens of nations."If the environment has a problem, we have a problem," he said in a telephone interview from New York of disruptions such as heatwaves, droughts, floods and storms linked to climate change."If we were a supplier of smartphones we would make them in one location and ship around the world," he said.Many companies are setting tougher environmental goals after almost 200 nations signed up for the 2015 Paris climate agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubts climate change has a human cause, plans to pull the United States out of the deal and instead promote fossil fuels.AB InBev plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2025, to the equivalent of 37.93 kg (83.62 lb) of carbon dioxide to produce a hectolitre of beer from 50.57 kg in 2017.Brito said the new goals for 2025 would include suppliers and wholesalers - beyond the company\'s previous environmental targets that focused on the company\'s core operations.The firm aims to cut water use, including by "restoring watersheds in areas that need it most, and improving water availability and quality for our communities," it said. It would work to ensure all farmers had needed skills by 2025.AB InBev was one of 74 companies on an "A list" for water reporting in 2017 from the independent London-based CDP, which monitors environmental performance by thousands of companies.It got a "B" for reporting on climate change in 2017 after an "A minus" in 2016.The firm will seek new ideas by scientists and entrepreneurs for everything from plastics recycling to better soil management in a project called the "100+ Sustainability Accelerator".Brito doubted that climate change would mean an ever hotter world that would boost beer sales by making people thirstier."Some places will likely get warmer, some will get colder," he said, adding ever more people drink beer indoors at home where temperatures are steadier than outside.(Reporting by Alister Doyle; Editing by Mark Potter)
LOS ANGELES   Two of the nation\'s prominent Republicans on Wednesday envisioned a future for the GOP far removed from President Donald Trump\'s Twitter blasts, where inclusiveness, a kinder tone and a willingness to work with Democrats on immigration and climate change shape the agenda.Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former California governor, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, another moderate Republican and 2016 Trump rival, talked of the need for both parties to move away from political extremes to address issues ranging from disparity in education to those left behind in a jobs-rich economy."I\'m sick of politics," Kasich, a potential 2020 presidential candidate, said at one point at a forum in Los Angeles, eliciting a round of applause.Knitting his fingers together repeatedly for emphasis, he said people need to work together, and he recalled President Ronald Reagan working with Democrats on Social Security.Reagan was no doctrinaire, Kasich said, but "operated to fix things."In an obvious dig at Trump, Schwarzenegger said that voters were looking for answers but that the party "is giving them Twitter fights instead." The president\'s name, however, came up only sparingly Wednesday."We can\'t be afraid to talk about health care," Schwarzenegger said. "We can\'t be afraid to talk about the environment."Their remarks came at an event organized by New Way California, a political committee eager to reshape the California GOP, which has been shedding voters for years. Republicans have become largely irrelevant in California government, where Democrats control every statewide office and dominate the Legislature.The effort to move the state party in a different direction comes at a time when Trump is the dominant figure in national Republican politics, and conservatives hold sway in Washington. Since Trump\'s election, California has emerged as a vanguard in the so-called Trump resistance, and Democratic state Attorney General Xavier Becerra has filed nearly 30 lawsuits to block administration proposals.New Way California was formed by Republican state lawmaker Chad Mayes, who was ousted as the party\'s Assembly leader after he worked with Democrats on climate change legislation.Mayes, a conservative, said the group hoped to "shed the stereotype of an intolerant Republican Party that serves only the rich and big businesses."While a registered Republican, Schwarzenegger is known for his varied political stripes. As far back as 2007, in his second term as governor, he warned that the GOP was "dying at the box office" and needed to claim issues usually associated with the Democratic agenda, such as climate change and health care reform.At the time, he said the GOP could win elections by "including, not excluding. By being open to new ideas."But there were few specifics Wednesday about how the group would achieve its goal of moving the GOP toward the political center. Schwarzenegger suggested cutting fundraising dollars for the state GOP, and Mayes talked of future activism.Kasich warned that political parties risk peril if they grow distant from voters."The consumers are getting frustrated," he said. "In an era of unbelievable change, you will begin to see parties crop up that will begin to serve their customers. ... You think our millennials care about what political party they\'re in?"California was once the home of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, but Republican influence in the state has been declining for years as a surge in immigrants transformed the state and its voting patterns.The combined total of Hispanics, blacks and Asians has outnumbered whites since 1998. Hispanics, who lean Democratic, surpassed whites as the state\'s largest racial or ethnic group in 2014. Republicans now account for only one in four voters in the state.California Republicans have bickered for years over what direction to turn  toward the political center or to the right.Party conservatives have long chaffed at moving away from what they see as bedrock values. In 2011, for example, moderate Republicans pushed changes to the state GOP platform that avoided any mention of overturning Roe v. Wade and dropped a demand to end virtually all federal and state benefits for people who entered the U.S. illegally. The proposal failed.Schwarzenegger appeared to nudge his old friend into considering another White House run. He urged Kasich, a former congressman, to "get back to Washington and kick some butt."
BRUSSELS   German conglomerate Bayer won EU antitrust approval on Wednesday for its $62.5 billion buy of U.S. peer Monsanto, the latest in a trio of mega mergers that will reshape the agrochemicals industry.The tie-up is set to create a company with control of more than a quarter of the world\'s seed and pesticides market.Driven by shifting weather patterns, competition in grain exports and a faltering global farm economy, Dow and Dupont, and ChemChina and Syngenta had earlier led a wave of consolidation in the sector.Both deals secured EU approval only after the companies offered substantial asset sales to boost rivals.Environmental and farming groups have opposed all three deals, worried about their power and their advantage in digital farming data, which can tell farmers how and when to till, sow, spray, fertilize and pick crops based on algorithms.The European Commission said Bayer addressed its concerns with its offer to sell a swathe of assets to boost rival BASF, confirming a Reuters story on Feb. 28."Our decision ensures that there will be effective competition and innovation in seeds, pesticides and digital agriculture markets also after this merger," European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement."In particular, we have made sure that the number of global players actively competing in these markets stays the same."Vestager said the Commission, which received more than a million petitions concerning the deal, had been thorough by examining more than 2,000 different product markets and 2.7 million internal documents to produce a 1,285-page ruling.The U.S. Justice Department, which is also reviewing the merger, said in a statement on its website that it would press on with its review and that the market in the two regions was quite different."While genetically modified seeds are largely prohibited in Europe, they are widely used throughout the United States," the department noted. "The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice continues to examine the effects of the proposed transaction on American farmers and consumers."China has given conditional approval to the Bayer and Monsanto deal, which has won a green light in Brazil. It is currently being reviewed by Russian antitrust authorities too.Australia said on Thursday it would not oppose the deal following the divestment commitment.Bayer has already reached a deal to sell certain seed and herbicide assets for 5.9 billion euros ($7.2 billion) to BASF and to give it a license to its global digital farming data. It will also divest its vegetable seeds business to BASF.The Commission is due to rule on the BASF deal by April 16.Online campaigns group Avaaz criticized the EU approval."This is a marriage made in hell. The Commission ignored a million people who called on them to block this deal, and caved in to lobbying to create a mega-corporation which will dominate our food supply," Avaaz legal director Nick Flynn said.U.S.-incorporated Avaaz, funded by its members, is active in climate change, poverty, conflict and corruption issues.The Greens grouping in the European Parliament echoed the sentiment, saying smaller players in the agriculture industry needed to be helped too."The agriculture industry is already far too concentrated, giving a handful of massive firms a stranglehold on food production. Merging two of the biggest players only makes a bad situation worse," Greens spokesman Bart Staes said.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee with additional reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington; editing by Robin Emmott, David Evans and Cynthia Osterman)

JAKARTA   In the Jakarta headquarters of the Indonesian Solidarity Party (PSI), workers call each other "bro" and "sis", and their leader sets the sartorial standard with a pair of ripped jeans.Dubbed the \'millennials party\', the PSI is an upstart on the political stage of this Southeast Asian nation that hopes to tap into young voters\' contempt for the entrenched corruption and divisive identity politics of the ruling elite.The downfall of long-serving autocrat Suharto in 1998 - amid a crisis widely blamed on a culture of nepotism and graft - brought an end to a regime of repression. But two decades later, the 190 million voters of the world\'s third-largest democracy are still asked to choose from a crowd of candidates who began their political careers during that period.The 2019 presidential election looks set to be a repeat of 2014, when current leader Joko Widodo narrowly defeated Prabowo Subianto, an ex-armed forces general who was formerly married to a daughter of Suharto.The PSI is one of four new parties the General Election Commission is allowing to contest next years legislative and presidential elections.Two of the new parties are fronted by establishment figures. The United Indonesia Party (Perindo) is headed by U.S. President Donald Trumps business partner in Indonesia, Hary Tanoeseodibjo,while the Berkaya Party is led by Suharto\'s youngest son, Tommy, who advocates a return to the "New Order" values of his late father.PSI leader Grace Natalie, a former television journalist, believes the time has come for a new generation of politicians who would be genuinely accountable to the people.Her party interviews members seeking nomination for a seat in parliament, and live-streams the discussions on social media platforms. Teachers, corporate lawyers, doctors and bankers are among those whose interviews have aired on Facebook and YouTube."No other party is offering what we are in terms of transparency," she told Reuters at PSI\'s headquarters -  referred to by party staff as "base camp" - where a wall poster urges "Make Art, Not War".CRITICAL DEMOGRAPHICNatalie, a 35-year-old mother of two toddlers, set up PSI in 2014, determined to offer an alternative for young voters. It\'s a critical demographic with people between the ages of 17 and 25 accounting for about 30 percent of the electorate. Two-thirds of the party\'s roughly 400,000 members are under 35.PSI relies on crowdfunding and donations to run operations across the vast archipelago of Indonesia, and to keep costs down it works from members\' houses and uses donated vehicles."This way, no one person can claim that they own the party. Everyone is contributing something," said Natalie, who was educated in Jakarta and the Netherlands, and speaks proficient English.So far, PSI has raised 2.6 billion rupiah ($180,000), a tiny sum compared to the coffers of mainstream parties that benefit from poor enforcement of laws limiting political donations.It will also struggle to get traction with the youth it is targeting.While the size of the youth vote bank has swelled from 18 percent of total voters in 2004 to 30 percent in 2014, the participation of young voters has dwindled.Data from the elections commission showed less than half of voters between 17 and 29 years old cast a ballot in 2014 legislative elections compared with around 90 percent among those over 30.Ella Prihatini, a researcher at the University of Western Australia, in a survey of 253 young voters, found many of them were uninterested in politics."On parliament, the dominant answer from respondents was that their MPs are not actually representing them, so why bother voting?" Prihatini said.POLITICAL ISLAMWinning support is also likely to be particularly challenging for Natalie, an ethnic-Chinese Indonesian, in a climate of religious and ethnic tensions. Indonesia is a secular country but concerns are growing about the Islamisation of politics in the world\'s largest Muslim-majority country.Jakarta\'s former governor, an ethnic-Chinese Christian, was ousted last year after hardline Muslim groups organized massive protests over allegations he insulted Islam. He was later jailed for blasphemy.The 14 parties contesting next year\'s polls include the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), which leads the ruling coalition, several other secular parties as well as  rising Islamic-oriented parties.Natalie, who plans to run for parliament next year, conceded she and PSI need a far bigger budget to win support in rural areas, home to nearly half of Indonesia\'s population. Her party will back Widodo - a popular moderate reformer - for re-election as president rather than try to field a candidate of its own.Ibrahim Irsyad Hasibuan, a 20-year-old journalism student from Tangerang outside Jakarta, said young voters are apathetic because they have no faith in the political system, and so PSI could be a wake-up call for his generation."But I can\'t relate to PSI," he said. "It is a new political party and has no track record yet."Achmad Sukarsono, a Singapore-based political analyst for Control Risks, was dismissive of the new party, arguing that an anti-corruption stance alone will not be enough to win over voters more interested in local and bread-and-butter issues."It is a nice utopian effort that shows desire for change from the educated, Westernized elite," he said.(Additional reporting by Jessica Damiana; Editing by John Chalmers and Bill Tarrant)
TAIPEI, Taiwan  A State Department official on Wednesday reasserted Americas commitment to Taiwans defense at a dinner attended by its president, a day after Chinas leader issued a stern warning against any challenges to Chinas claim to the island.The aim of U.S. policy is to ensure that Taiwans people can continue along their chosen path, free from coercion, the official, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Alex Wong, said at the banquet in Taipei, Taiwans capital, as President Tsai Ing-wen looked on.Speaking to 700 people, including representatives of top American companies and senior Taiwanese officials, at an American Chamber of Commerce function, Mr. Wong said the United States wanted to strengthen our ties with the Taiwan people and to bolster Taiwans ability to defend its democracy.Our commitment to those goals has never been stronger, added Mr. Wong, whose remarks came less than week after President Trump, over Chinas objection, signed the Taiwan Travel Act, a measure encouraging official, high-level visits between the United States and Taiwan.On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping of China issued a thinly veiled threat to Washington and Taipei during a speech to the National Peoples Congress in Beijing. Any actions and tricks to split China are doomed to failure, Mr. Xi said in a stridently nationalistic speech, and will meet with the peoples condemnation and punishment of history.The National Peoples Congress this month removed term limits on Mr. Xis presidency, setting up the possibility he may hold the top posts of Chinas government, military and the Communist Party for life.In Taipei, Mr. Wong praised Taiwans democratic path and took a shot at Mr. Xis tightening grip on power. Dynamic, broad-based and sustainable growth can never hinge on the whim of a dictator, he said.Hours after Mr. Xis speech, the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning traveled through the Taiwan Strait, according to a statement issued by Taiwans Ministry of National Defense. Passing through the strait is increasingly commonplace for the Liaoning, though the Taiwanese ministry noted that the carrier stayed on the Chinese side and exhibited no unusual behavior.The Peoples Republic of China, as China is formally known, claims Taiwan as its sovereign territory. But the Peoples Republic has never ruled Taiwan, which is administered by the Republic of China government that lost to Mao Zedongs Communist forces in the Chinese civil war seven decades ago.Taiwan is functionally independent, with its own Constitution, military, democratic elections, currency and customs regime. Republic of China passports carried by Taiwanese are accepted by immigration authorities around the world.On the surface, the Taiwan Travel Act does not appear to change much. It offers only a sense of Congress that the United States government should encourage visits between officials from the United States and Taiwan at all levels.But despite a highly polarized climate in Washington, the bill received remarkable bipartisan support, passing unanimously in both the House and the Senate in the face of a vigorous campaign by the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai.Mr. Cui took the extraordinary step of sending letters to members of Congress threatening severe consequences for the relationship between China and the United States if the measure passed, The Washington Post reported in October.Relations between the worlds two largest economies were shaken in the first days of the Trump era, in December 2016, when Mr. Trump, then the president-elect, accepted a congratulatory phone call from Ms. Tsai. After becoming president, though, Mr. Trump reiterated Americas one China policy, which acknowledges but does not recognize Beijings claim on Taiwan, and sought Mr. Xis help in pressing North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.But Mr. Trump has nominated Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, who is widely viewed as pro-Taiwan and tough on China, to succeed Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state. And the confirmation of Randall Schriver, who is also seen as pro-Taiwanese, as assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs also suggested a closer and more open relationship with Taiwan.Ms. Tsai said Wednesday night that she was grateful to the Trump administration for pushing ahead with the Taiwan Travel Act.A test of how things might change under the legislation will come with the opening of a new diplomatic compound for the American Institute in Taiwan. The A.I.T. is the unofficial American diplomatic mission in Taiwan, staffed by State Department employees. Ms. Tsai said she would attend the compounds opening, but it is not known who the highest-ranking American will be.The United States broke off formal diplomatic ties with Taipei in 1979 in order to establish relations with Beijing, when both capitals claimed to be the sole ruler of China. Since then, Taiwan has effectively given up its claim to China, but Beijing still claims Taiwan.American policy toward Taiwan is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, passed in 1979, which states that the future of the Taiwanese people must be decided peacefully, while requiring that the United States provide the island with means to defend itself.In recent decades, Taiwan, once autocratic, has evolved from strategic American ally used to contain China into a vital and democratic trade partner important in the American technology supply chain.For senior U.S. officials, coming to Taiwan better enables them to appreciate the islands critical role in global supply chains that produce semiconductors and other high-tech products that are crucial to U.S. industry, said William Foreman, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, in an interview.The Taipei chamber has more than 1,000 members from roughly 500 companies. While addressing chamber members, Mr. Wong echoed administration complaints about Beijings approach to business and trade.Unfortunately, there are actors who fail to pay due respect for the obligations they have voluntarily signed up for, Mr. Wong said. When economies large or small are able to flout the rules, cheat their trading partners, force intellectual property transfer, protect national champions, steal trade secrets and use market-distorting subsidies, it undermines the integrity of the entire rules-based system.
